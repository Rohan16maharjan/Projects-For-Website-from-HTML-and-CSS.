		<p><h2>About Mv Agusta</h2></p>
		<p>It all began in the early years of the 20th century, when Count Giovanni Agusta left Sicily for northern Italy, where he built his first aircraft, the AG.1, four years after the Wright brothers had made history in the US. The First World War, which demonstrated the prospects of aviation, prompted the count to act decisively — and in 1923, in the town of Samarate, he founded the Costruzioni Aeronautiche Giovanni Agusta S.A. (usually shortened to Agusta) aircraft factory. However, in 1927, at the age of 48, he dies and leaves his life's work to his wife Giuseppina and sons, Domenico, Vincenzo, Mario and Corrado.</p>

		<p>Aircraft orders were plentiful, and business generally went well until World War II intervened. In 1945, following the provisions of the peace treaty after the war, which were later reiterated in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, the production of aircraft was forbidden to Italy, and the Agusta family had to think quick to save their high-tech business and keep their employees in work.In the midst of World War II Count Domenico Agusta came to the idea that the best way to diversify the business and turn it into a peaceful channel would be to create a motorcycle production. Moreover, he understood that a country gutted by war would need a simple, cheap and efficient machine. Therefore, by August 1943, the engine was ready: a 98 cc single-cylinder two-stroke with two-stage gear box. And even if the total shortage of spare parts had to resort to the services of the black market, the process was already launched — and on January 19, 1945, in the town of Cascina Costa (near the Malpensa airport near Milan), a private company Meccanica Verghera S.r.l. was registered, and in the fall of the same year the first motorcycle was presented.</p>

		<p>At a dealership on Via Piatti in Milan in late October 1945, the press saw a pre-production model of a light motorcycle with a steel tube rigid frame, a girder fork and 19-inch wheels. The gas tank was marked with large letters M and V. It was called "Vespa 98". However Domenico had had to refuse from the spectacular name Vespa (English: wasp): by that time it was occupied by Piaggio for its Vespa motorscooter. Therefore, in 1946, the motorcycle was put ro mass production as MV 98 and in two versions: Economica (the version presented a year earlier) and Turismo (it was distinguished by the presence of a three-speed gearbox and a rear suspension). The Turismo (English: tourist) version proved to be so overwhelmingly popular that before long the Economica (English: economic) version was discontinued. In 1946, about 50 units were produced.</p>
